Patterns

 The first line is reserved for size information.
 size is meta data for placing figure in right position
 ',' adds y += 1
 '#' adds z += 1 
 '//' can be used for comments in empty lines, or after ',' or '#' character (not in the first line)
 Name of the pattern can be anything (defined on tasks)

Tasks

 Naming must respond 'taskXXX' where XXX correspond index of task and starts from 001. Cannot hop over numbers.
 Line numbers must be following:
   1. first figure filename ( without '.txt' ending)
   2. first figure position
   3. first figure rotation
   4. second figure filename
   5. second figure is mirrored? 
   6. offset position
   7. offset rotation
